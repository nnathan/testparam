# testparam

A linter to check that the correct parameter is used inside `testing.T.Run(...)`.

I thought this already existed, because I'm sure vim at one time warned me about
making this mistake, but I can't seem to find it anywhere.

See `tmp/foo_test.go` the TestSimple2 case to see exactly what I'm talking about.
